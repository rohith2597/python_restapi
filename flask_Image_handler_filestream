"""This is a basic REST API handler using FLask which receives Image as a file and open it as the image using Pillow(Python library) 
and then we can save or process the image according to the requirement and a simple JSON response is sent back to the client. 
You can test it using Postman(Tool for testing API). In postman you need to give the correct URL and set body as form-data and select 
file in KEY and in VALUE select the image.
